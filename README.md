## What this branch does

Turns a Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 into a passive WiFi receiver that watches 2.4 GHz management and data frames for Flock Safety MAC OUIs. No AP, no transmit — the radio stays dedicated to sniffing while the device hops channels 11 / 6 / 1 (descending) at 350 ms dwell.

Every detection is:

- beeped (piezo on GPIO3) and flashed (onboard LED on GPIO21)
- written to on-device SPIFFS in an atomic CRC-envelope format, surviving power loss
- emitted as one JSON line over USB CDC in the schema `api/flockyou.py` expects, so the Flask dashboard auto-ingests it with GPS temporal matching

The device works standalone (no USB host needed) and plugged in (live dashboard) without any mode switch.

## DeFlock Joplin Research Continues - Behavior and IE Fingerprint

Earlier descriptions of Flock behavior are different than what I have observed.  This firmware is based on my observations. I do not make claims that others are incorrect or that this behavior has always existed.

**Past Flock Camera Behavior**
In the past, Flock cameras were detectable by the AP they were broadcasting for management.  Some time around December 2025, this AP was deactivated.  The community began using other detection methods like BLE.  Those stopped working some time in the spring.

**Current Camera Behavior**
These observations are not meant to cast doubt on anyone else's.  These cameras are not managed well and are updated OTA.  

Observations:
Flock cameras transmit wildcard probe requests on wi-fi channels in ascending order.  These probes are emitted at around .125 second intervals (credit to nsm_barii for orginal observations of both of these).  These probes are essentially a WiFi client asking any AP to respond with the SSID of the AP.  Hidden SSIDs generally require you send the exact SSID in the probe to generate a response.  See [here](https://goodwi.fi/posts/2023/12/hunt-for-hidden-probe/).  Flock cameras are also known to use cellular LTE modems to upload to the Flock cloud.

Given this, I have disabled all other detection methods in this branch.  While they are associated with Flock cameras, they are essentially all echoes of the camera itself, which is only gated by OUI match.  The other methods can fire when any OUI matched device is sending wildcard probes because nearby APs can respond and generate a false positive match on addr1 or addr3 methods.

The new method relies on IE fingerprinting research done by others in the past such [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367065691_Analysis_of_Wi-Fi_Probe_Requests_Towards_Information_Element_Fingerprinting).  According to the linked paper, IE field detection can already be a high confidence identifier, but we combine it with the OUI list collected by @NitekryDPaul for an extremely certain signature.  To the point that I have not experience a false postive after hundreds of miles of driving. Other detection methods have trended towards more active methods, but this is entirely passive. 

I have also enabled descending channel hopping and reduced dwell time to 250 ms (2x observed hop time) to assist with faster intercept with a Flock signal.

Hypothesis on probe behavior:
When the wifi management AP was disabled around December, the devices moved from AP mode to STA mode.  The probes likely began at this time. The devices now appear to enumerating networks, perhaps as a default behavior and not something Flock has explicitly set.

The tightened signature that's active on this branch:

1. Frame is 802.11 Management, type=0 subtype=4 (**Probe Request**)
2. SSID Information Element (tag 0) is present with **length 0** (wildcard)
3. `addr2` (transmitter) matches the known-OUI list
4. IE fields match signature collected by Michael / DeFlock Joplin

When we get a hit, we emit `detection_method: wifi_wildcard_probe_ie_sig`. Broad OUI paths (`wifi_wildcard_probe`, `wifi_oui_addr2`, `wifi_oui_addr1`, `wifi_oui_addr3`) are disabled in firmware — IE fingerprint on uplink probe requests is the active detection path.

## Detection pipeline

```
  [2.4GHz air]
       │
       ▼
  wifiSniffer()                 ← IRAM promiscuous callback (WiFi task)
       │                          fast match only, no Serial / no malloc
       ▼
  alertQueue[32]                ← lock-free ring buffer (ISR-safe mux)
       │
       ▼
  drainAlertQueue()             ← loop() context, per-iteration drain
       │
       ├─► fyAddDetection()           ← always, every hit
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fyDet[200]                 ← unique-by-MAC on-device table
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   autosaveTick()             ← every 60s when dirty
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fySaveSession()            ← atomic CRC-envelope write to SPIFFS
       │
       ├─► shouldSuppressDuplicate()  ← 5s per-MAC serial-emit rate limit
       │
       └─► emitDetectionJSON()        ← USB CDC line for Flask
            buzzerBeep() + ledFlash()
```

The split between callback and loop is deliberate: the WiFi task has hard real-time constraints and cannot call `Serial.print` or `malloc` safely. The callback writes only to the lock-free ring buffer; `loop()` does all the heavy work.

## OUI target list (@NitekryDPaul research)

All lowercase, colon-separated. 31 Flock Safety infrastructure prefixes:

```

```

Pre-compiled into a byte table in `setup()` so the matcher stays entirely in IRAM with no flash-resident lookups during callback execution.

Full dataset and methodology: [`datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md`](datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md).

## SPIFFS wire format

On-flash layout, atomic and crash-safe:

```
Line 1: {"v":1,"count":N,"bytes":B,"crc":"0xXXXXXXXX"}
Line 2: [{"mac":"...","method":"...","rssi":...,...},...]
```

Save procedure:

1. Compute CRC32 + byte count over the serialised payload
2. Write envelope header + payload to `/session.tmp`
3. Re-read and re-validate `/session.tmp` (CRC check)
4. Remove `/session.json`
5. Atomic rename `/session.tmp` → `/session.json` (copy+delete fallback)

Boot recovery:

1. If `/session.json` validates, promote it to `/prev_session.json`
2. Otherwise try `/session.tmp` (interrupted save)
3. Delete both working files, start with an empty live table
4. `/prev_session.json` stays around for inspection

CRC32 uses the standard `0xEDB88320` polynomial so the same file can be verified on a host with any off-the-shelf CRC tool.

## Flask dashboard integration

The firmware emits one JSON line per detection in the same schema the BLE detector uses, so `api/flockyou.py` picks it up with zero changes:

```json
{"event":"detection","detection_method":"wifi_oui_addr2","protocol":"wifi_2_4ghz","mac_address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","oui":"aa:bb:cc","device_name":"","rssi":-62,"channel":6,"frequency":2437,"ssid":""}
```

`detection_method` values:

- `wifi_wildcard_probe_ie_sig` — **Probe Request + wildcard SSID + primary Flock IE signature** from a known OUI (PACK method 2 PoC; no rolling-window gates). Supersedes the removed `wifi_wildcard_probe` tier (same wildcard/OUI gates plus IE-field verification).
- `wifi_oui_addr2` — *(disabled in firmware)* transmitter-side OUI match on any frame
- `wifi_oui_addr1` — *(disabled in firmware)* receiver-side OUI match (the @NitekryDPaul technique)
- `wifi_oui_addr3` — *(disabled in firmware)* BSSID OUI on mgmt frames; broad OUI-only filter, false-positive prone
- `wifi_ssid` — SSID keyword match (disabled by default)

### GPS wardriving

GPS is handled Flask-side, since the ESP32 radio is dedicated to sniffing and there's no on-device AP. Two options:

- **USB NMEA puck** plugged into the host running Flask — Flask reads NMEA and timestamps a GPS timeline
- **Flask dashboard open in a phone browser** — browser Geolocation API posts updates to Flask

Flask does a temporal match between detection timestamp and GPS timeline, then exports JSON / CSV / KML for Google Earth.

### Running Flask

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flockyou.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`, pick your serial port from the UI, detections start showing up live.

## Hardware

### Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 (default: `xiao_esp32s3`)

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO 3 | Piezo buzzer |
| GPIO 21 | Onboard user LED (active low) |
| GPIO 43 | Serial1 TX mirror (115200 baud) |

### LilyGO T-Dongle S3 (`lilygo_t_dongle_s3`). Added because Michael lost his OUI-Spy for testing.

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO 1–5, 38 | ST7735 display (RST, DC, MOSI, CS, SCLK, backlight) |
| GPIO 39 / 40 | APA102 RGB LED (clock / data) — red flash on detection |
| USB CDC | Serial JSON for Flask dashboard |

**Display:** idle screen shows `SCANNING`, current WiFi channel, and unique hit count. On each emitted detection, shows `DETECT`, method, MAC, RSSI, and channel for **5 s**, then returns to idle. Backlight is driven on init (GPIO 38 active-low).

No buzzer on this env.

Boot sound (XIAO only): first 6 notes of Super Mario Bros. World 1-2 (underground).

---

## Build and flash

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

```bash
pio run -e xiao_esp32s3              # Seeed XIAO (default)
pio run -e lilygo_t_dongle_s3        # LilyGO T-Dongle S3

pio run -e xiao_esp32s3 -t upload    # flash XIAO
pio run -e lilygo_t_dongle_s3 -t upload   # flash T-Dongle (hold BOOT if port missing)
pio device monitor
```

`platformio.ini` and `partitions.csv` are at the root (1.9 MB SPIFFS partition, 6 MB app). The T-Dongle env adds **TFT_eSPI** for the onboard display; XIAO needs no extra libraries.

## Standalone vs connected

**Without USB:** device boots, plays the SMB 1-2 intro, starts scanning, stores every unique detection to SPIFFS, flashes the onboard LED on each hit. Plug in later — the prior session is sitting in `/prev_session.json`.

**With USB + Flask running:** same thing, plus every detection streams live to the dashboard as a JSON line. Flask adds GPS (if configured) and deduplicates across MAC, building the wardriving map as you move.

Both modes work simultaneously — the SPIFFS write path doesn't care if a host is listening.

## BLE companion firmware

The BLE-only sibling of this firmware lives on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/flock-you/tree/main). It detects Flock and Raven gear via BLE advertisements (OUI prefix, device name, manufacturer ID `0x09C8`, Raven service UUIDs), runs its own WiFi AP with a phone-facing dashboard at `192.168.4.1`, and emits the same Flask JSON schema. Flash both on separate boards for overlapping BLE + WiFi coverage feeding one Flask dashboard.
